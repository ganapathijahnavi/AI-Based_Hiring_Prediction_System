resume screening dataset. The dataset contained textual, numerical, and categorical features representing candidate qualifications, experience, and job-related information.\n","\n","During preprocessing, identifier columns were removed and the AI score column was excluded to prevent data leakage. Text features were cleaned and transformed using TF-IDF vectorization, while numerical features were scaled using StandardScaler. Education was encoded for model compatibility. Stratified train-test splitting was applied due to class imbalance.\n","\n","Four models were trained and compared: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN. Logistic Regression achieved the best performance with 98.5% test accuracy and strong cross-validation results. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV confirmed C=10 as the optimal regularization parameter.\n","\n","A complete prediction function was implemented using a Pipeline to simulate a real-world AI hiring system. The model can now accept candidate inputs and return both hiring decisions and probability scores.\n","\n","This project demonstrates practical knowledge of:\n","\n","1. Data preprocessing\n","2. Text feature engineering\n","3. Handling class imbalance\n","4. Preventing data leakage\n","5. Model comparison\n","6. Hyperparameter tuning\n","7. Pipeline construction\n","8. Deployment-ready prediction systems\n","\n","The system reflects how AI can support HR automation by assisting recruiters in resume screening while maintaining structured and explainable decision-making."],"metadata":{"id":"tnN39pogEHHV"}}]}
